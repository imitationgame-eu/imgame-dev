"Q<:>What is your attitude toward gay marriage and adoption of children by gay couples?"
1,0
"NPR<:> I am pro gay marriage ? it definitely makes formalising a relationship simpler and will make life easier in many cases (information and consent in the hospital, inheritance issues). As to adoption I am pro adoption of a biological child of someone's partner. As to adopting a 'strange' child, I don't know. I think that loving daddies are better than the foster home but each case should be treated individually."

I work with a computer and usually in the evening when I have a bit of spare time  my eye strain makes it hard to keep focused and I usually don't read. But I do listen to audiobooks ? the last one I listened to wass game of thrones, a great version with several dozen actors and nice music. I used to read Steven King and a bit of queer stuff (Hollinghurst etc.)"

I think that they should come out and I hope that in the future it won't be such a bombshell. There is no reasons that there shouldn't be 'representatives' of  the gay community everywhere, among politicians, actors... Because then it is easier for people to accept homosexuality, people will talk about it more, 'Have you heard that Daley is a fag'? 'So what, I am too!' :P "
