the listener can be loaded with several command-line parameters

e.g. nohup php servermulti.php f:test d:imgame.cf.ac.uk

f: is the filename to use for the logfile (in this case test.txt)
d: is the domain name to use when making a sockets connection
      (normally this is hard-wired in the code, but may be overridden on
       command line, for instance using stage from outside the campus network)
