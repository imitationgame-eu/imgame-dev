            <p>A survey has 3 main sections and a some global settings that are displayed on each section. The survey cannot be used by end-users until the "definition complete" setting is on. Form title and form instruction are self-explanatory, and can be left blank if not required.</p>
            <p>The start page can be used to provide fuller instructions, and can be configured to use an eligibility question to ensure the participant agrees that they fit the recruitment criteria.</p>
            <p>A dynamic number of pages can be defined, or if the survey is used only for eligibility they can be ignored.</p>
            <p>A final instruction page can also be configured but can be switched off if not required.</p>
