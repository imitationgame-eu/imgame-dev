## dev branch of imgame application.
### Status

These notes reflect current deployment to imitationgame.co.uk and the clean codebase/SQL committed here ready for deployment/installation for use by anyone who wishes.
Documentation on how to use the software is available at http://imitationgame.co.uk/doc/info.html


### Thanks and acknowledgements
Thanks to all those people who have written, posted or blogged guides that I have used whilst preparing my systems. Big kudos.

#### Deployment instructions
##### Summary
- Configure a LAMP stack server
- Deploy codebase to website
- Install clean SQL tables
- Domain specific information
- Operations

##### LAMP-stack server
This clean system has been built and configured on AlmaLinux9. The system must provide console access to be able to run CLI PHP scripts for STEP1 of any experiment.
The following guides are helpful in preparing a base server:-

The production version is deployed to a Hybrid VPS host. Dev versions can be installed on local VMs (VMWare, Hyper-X etc). 

Ensure the MYSQL installation is secured and ensure at least the MySQL root user/password is known.

##### Codebase
If imgame will be the only website running on the server then copy the full codebase structure into the default web document directory. If not, configure a virtual host for an additional website. Ensure Apache has group ownership of the whole structure. (Apache on AlamLinux9, www-data on some Ubuntu systems).

If making changes to a dev version of the site, I find it useful to create an SFTP user and make this user a member of the apache or www-data group and use WinSCP to push code to the server.

##### SQL
Extract sql/igrt_clean.zip and use MySQL Workbench or equivalent to build a data schema and import the tables and stored-procedures into the schema. Create a database user with full DBA access to the schema, tables etc.

##### Domain specifics
The database connection is configured in /domainSpecific/mySQLObject.php
There is also a file /domainSpecific/cliEnvironment.php which is used to define the deployed domain name used in CLI PHP scripts such as the Step1 listener/controller.
If you are using SMTP to handle user registration, password management etc (recommended), then you will need to configure /classes/mailer.php

##### Operations
###### Documentation
There is in-built online documentation accessed from yourdomain/doc/info.html
###### SMTP
If the installer of the system will also be supporting and using the system and is reasonably competent with SQL then managing many of the aspects system can be directly achieved by manipulating tables, but if multiple users/researchers will be using the system then it is recommended that the system be configured as an SMTP server (or linked to an existing SMTP server) so that the full suite of user management functions can be used.
If this is the case, then the system will need to be hardened so that emails do not get rejected by major emails systems such as gmail, MS, etc. The following guides may be helpful:-
